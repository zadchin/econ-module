## Decision Tree

Decision trees are tree-like models that make decisions based on asking a series of questions about the features of the data. Starting from a root node, the tree splits the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each step. This process continues recursively, forming branches and leaves, until a stopping criterion is met. The leaf nodes represent the final decisions or predictions. A simple decision tree classifying heart disease is as follow:

## Implementation of Algorithm

Next, we will run deciscion tree on our training dataset, then compute the performance of the metrics using our dataset.

```{pyodide-python}
# importing libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, accuracy_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score, confusion_matrix

# reading data and defining features
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zadchin/econ-module/master/cleaned_loandata.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_url)
features = data.drop("Risk_Flag", axis = 1) 
target = data.Risk_Flag 

# train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size = 0.3, random_state=42)

# print to make sure train-test split is completed
print("X train shape: ", X_train.shape)
print("X test shape: ", X_test.shape)

# Call on decision tree function imported
DT_model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_leaf_nodes=3, max_depth=None,
                                  class_weight="balanced")

# Train the model on X_train, y_train (training data)
DT_model = DT_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test the model on X_test (testing data)
y_pred_DT = DT_model.predict(X_test)

# Print result
print("Accuracy: ", np.round(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_DT), 2))
print("Precision: ",np.round(precision_score(y_test, y_pred_DT), 2))
print("Recall: ",np.round(recall_score(y_test, y_pred_DT), 2))
print("F1 Score: ", np.round(f1_score(y_test, y_pred_DT), 2))
```


## Discussion: What is the pro and cons of deciscion tree?



## Visualizing the tree

```{pyodide-python}
feature_names = list(X_train.columns)
text_representation = tree.export_text(DT_model, feature_names=feature_names)
print(text_representation)
```
