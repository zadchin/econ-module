abstract = {A statistician, an algologist and a biochemist sat down to a nice cup of tea. The algologist would not drink hers. It sounds like the start of a bad joke. It was actually the beginning – the rather romantic beginning – of proper design and analysis of experiments. Stephen Senn considers how that time-honoured British institution, the tea-break, inspired R. A. Fisher to an approach which still raises questions today.},
